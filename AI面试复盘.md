# bias with multi-level social data

multi-level social data: interaction/ relationship in individual, group, organization

减少数据偏见
- sampling frame
- measurement instruments

模型显示处理多层次的信息
- group mean centering 来区分 within-/ between- group impact
- 控制 confounding：每一层引入尽可能多的 covariates 来捕捉同一层的 interaction

使用个人样本估计群体
- EB 估计值代替平均值
- MLC 模型/empirical Bayes
- Sensitivity Analyses: 不同的模型选择（超参数，centering，correction）有 consistent result 吗
